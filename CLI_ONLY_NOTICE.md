# CLI-Only Mode Notice

## Current Status: CLI-Only Interface

The MAN Scraper Suite is currently operating in **CLI-only mode** while the web dashboard undergoes development and testing.

### Available Features (CLI)

All core functionality is fully available through the command-line interface:

- ✅ Web scraping (static and dynamic)
- ✅ Social media scraping (Reddit, Twitter)
- ✅ PDF and image extraction
- ✅ AI-powered data analysis
- ✅ Smart data filtering
- ✅ Multi-format exports (JSON, CSV, Excel, PDF)
- ✅ Cloud integration (Google Sheets)
- ✅ Proxy testing and stealth features
- ✅ Configuration management

### Quick Start

```bash
# Basic usage
python manscrapersuite.py --help

# Interactive mode (recommended for beginners)
python manscrapersuite.py --interactive

# Direct CLI access
python -m omniscraper.cli --help
```

### Web Dashboard Status

The web dashboard (`site.py` model) is temporarily disabled for:
- Security testing and hardening
- Performance optimization
- Feature completion and testing
- UI/UX improvements

### When Will Web Dashboard Return?

The web dashboard will be re-enabled once:
1. All security tests pass
2. Performance benchmarks are met  
3. User interface is polished
4. Documentation is complete

### Need Help?

Use the interactive mode for a guided experience:
```bash
python manscrapersuite.py --interactive
```

All functionality remains available - just through the robust CLI interface instead of the web dashboard.
